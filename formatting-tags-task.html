    <p><b><abbr title=" Hiper text markup language">HTML</abbr></b> and <b><abbr title="Cascading style Sheets">CSS</abbr></b> are the foundation of all web development. HTML stands for <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HyperText Markup Language</abbr>, and it is used to structure the content of a <em>webpage</em>. CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is used to style the layout and appearance of that content.
For example, to make a heading in HTML, you can use the code: <code><h1>This is a heading</h1></code>. Similarly, to apply <em>color</em> using CSS, you can write: <code>color: blue;.</code>

A basic HTML structure includes the <strong> DOCTYPE declaration, html, head, and body</strong> tags. It is important to maintain proper indentation <blockquote> the code remains clean and readable.</blockquote>

You can save an HTML file with the <code>extension .html</code>, and open it in a <em>browser</em> to see the result. Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> to save the file. </p>
